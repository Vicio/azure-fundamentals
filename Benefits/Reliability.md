The ability of a system to recover from failures

### Failures that can occur in a well designed system
* Hardware failures (disk fail, CPU overheat, RAM  corruption)
* Network issues
* Power failures
* Regional outages

### How is it achieved?
* Auto-scaling (as traffic comes in more resources are brought automatically)
* Avoiding single points of failure by using redundancy
* Always deploy on multiple regions
* Constant backups of data and snapshots
* Health monitoring
