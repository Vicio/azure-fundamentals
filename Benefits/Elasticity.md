When a system is capable of vertical scaling in response to variations in resource demands. It needs to be done through automation. Sometimes is called **"auto-scaling"**.
The system is constantly monitored for utilization of the resources. Adds resources when a threshold is surpassed and removes them when the threshold falls behind.

### Why is it needed?
* Resources are handled more efficiently
* Waste resources is reduced
* No need to over-provision resources.
* Theoretically speaking there is no maximum capacity
