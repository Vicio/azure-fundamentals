The ability to increase or remove resources as needed to accommodate for the demand. It is highly dependent on the parallelization of the application itself.

### Why is it needed?
You can adapt to changing usage patterns without having to do any code changes or design changes.
Some businesses have traffic that fluctuates depending on the time of day or the day of year, like black Friday.
Another example is school registrations, where usually all students sign in for classes in during only one week.

## Vertical scaling
It means adjusting hardware without changing the system itself, e.g. increasing RAM, disk, CPU. It is limited to the resources of a single server. However, there is an upper limit since the hardware has some limitations, like RAM slots or supported CPUS.
## Horizontal scaling
The addition of more servers to increase capacity, there are no limits to scaling, even in different regions or boundaries, however, you add complexity to the implementation.
### Impact on system cost
Costs increase linearly with the amount of servers or hardware increase, but also cost can reduce linearly if you require less resources.
In the cloud you can get the perfect fit anytime, as sometimes it is adjusted to your utilized resources.
