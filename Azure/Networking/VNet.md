When you create a virtual network, you can define an address space of either IPv4 or IPv6. These addresses are private, which means they cannot be accessed outside Azure.

When the VNet is created, the Vnet is usually assigned a large address space of IPs, which allows for growth. All VNets are divided into [[Subnets]].
