Also called NSGs, are type of access control lists that provide access to VMs depending on predefined rules. Rules are based on different protocols and routes.

Communication can be allowed between subnets. You need an "Allow" rule to permit the pass of communication through a specific protocol and to a specific device. There are also "Deny" rules which take higher priority than "Allow" rules.
