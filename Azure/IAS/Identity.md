The representation of a person, device or application. All of them can have an identity inside a server in order to have access to functionalities.

Identification usually requires a proof of your identity, this can be done via a password, a key or a certificate. This is usually called [[Authentication]]. Another concept is [[Authorization]] in which once you're authenticated, there is a level of actions you're allowed to do.

There are two main technologies for identity in azure:
* [[Active Directory]]
* [[Entra ID]]

There are multiple benefits of using identity:
* [[Security]]
* Easier development and support
* Centralized administration
* Single sign-on
* Integration with other Azure services
