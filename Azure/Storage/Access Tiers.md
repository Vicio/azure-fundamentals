There are different access methods to your cloud data, the access depends on where is the data stored, and hence determines how fast you can access to it.
The existing four tiers are:
* Hot - The balanced option (equivalent to using SSDs)
* Cool - A slower option (equivalent to HDDs)
* Cold - Even slower (equivalent to magnetic tapes)
* Archive - Ultra slow storage (equivalent to specialized optical discs)
Each access tier has a different amount/operation cost, hot has the most cost per GB stored whereas archive has the most cost per GB read/written.
